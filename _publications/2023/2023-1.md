abstract:       "Cell morphology analysis is a crucial diagnostic tool for identifying blood diseases, including acute leukemia.
However, the traditional analysis process is time-consuming and requires significant investment in labor and 
expertise from laboratory doctors. In recent years, deep learning-based automatic blood cell classification 
techniques have gained popularity. But acquiring image data and annotations in the medical field is often 
challenging and costly. With the increasing use of deep learning techniques in clinical practice, it has become 
vital to ensure both accuracy and high-quality annotations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes 
a blood cell classification method based on Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and active learning (AL), namely 
MAE4AL. This method utilizes the self-supervised loss of MAE and sample uncertainty to select the most 
valuable samples for labeling. A comprehensive comparison is conducted between our method and the state-of-
the-art blood cell classification technique, which employed ResNeXt. Remarkably, our proposed approach 
achieves comparable classification performance to ResNeXt when utilizing only 20% of the labeled data. When 
employing half of the labeled data, our method achieves a classification accuracy of 96.36%, surpassing the 
ResNeXt model trained with 100% labeled data by 0.79%."
