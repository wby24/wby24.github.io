  Cell morphology analysis is a crucial diagnostic tool for identifying blood diseases. This paper proposes a blood cell classification method based on Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and active learning (AL) to select the most valuable samples for labeling. The proposed approach achieves comparable classification performance to SOTA method based on ResNeXt when utilizing only 20% of the labeled data.
