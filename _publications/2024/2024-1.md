abstract: >-
  Small insertions and deletions (indels) are critical yet challenging genetic variations with significant clinical implications. In this paper, we developed INDELpred, a machine-learning-based predictive model for discerning pathogenic from benign indels. We envisage INDELpred as a desirable tool for the detection of pathogenic indels within large-scale genomic datasets, thereby enhancing the precision of genetic diagnoses in clinical settings.
